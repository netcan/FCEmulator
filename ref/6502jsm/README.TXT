The Quick 6502 Instruction Set


6502JSM.TXT is for edit.com from Windows NT.  It should look fine in 
OS's as well.  *nix's come to mind.  I haven't tested this yet, anyone?

6502JSM.DOC is for word/write.exe for win9x.  I did this so that it 
will print with everything correctly alligned.


All I really did here folks was fix up some documentation that was laying
around on the net.  This entire section is going to be included in my 
document on the 6502, but with much more detail and explaination. 

This document was based on 6502sum.txt.  I could not dig any info up on the 
original author to contact him to let him know I was modifing his doc, tho 
it appears all he did was copy some info from sources _he_ had laying around :)

I can be contacted via jmullins@tidalwave.net if you have any questions, or
feel any information listed here is incorrect and/or has error's somewhere.

You can distribute this however you wish, none of this is copyright.  I do
however wish to be contacted when and if you make changes to it.  If you
are a newbie to assembly, or the 6502, and can hold out for a little while 
longer, I am in the process of making a rather snazzy document on the 6502 
that should be much more informative and easier to read than this document.
I do not however, know when it will be completed.  So please don't ask :)
